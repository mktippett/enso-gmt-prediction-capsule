# Reproduction capsule — ENSO-conditioned evolution of global mean surface temperature

Everything needed — and nothing more — to reproduce the figures and tables of:

> Tippett, M. K.: *ENSO-conditioned evolution of global mean surface
> temperature.* Preprint: <https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/13005/>

**Contract:** `make all` regenerates all 12 figures and 6 tables used by the
manuscript from the frozen data in `data/` alone.

This repository follows a general **reproduction capsule** pattern: trace a
manuscript's cited figures/tables back to the code that produces them, port
the minimal code and frozen data into a standalone repo, verify byte/pixel
identity against the original analysis, then publish. That workflow — the
dependency trace, the verification gates, the privacy cleanup discipline —
has since been generalized into a reusable method for producing capsules like
this one from other manuscripts.

## Browse the code and figures (no clone required)

Executed notebooks with every figure inline (retina resolution), viewable
straight on GitHub:

- [`notebooks/global_temperature_enso-prediction.ipynb`](notebooks/global_temperature_enso-prediction.ipynb)
- [`notebooks/nmme_comparison.ipynb`](notebooks/nmme_comparison.ipynb)

These are a viewing convenience, **not** part of the reproduction contract:
the authoritative source is `scripts/*.py`, and `make all` is what regenerates
the manuscript outputs. Refresh them with `make notebooks` (see
`scripts/build_notebooks.py`).

## Quick start

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml    # or: mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate enso-gmt-capsule

make all          # 12 figures -> figures/ , 6 tables -> tables/
make manuscript   # compile manuscript/manuscript.pdf from those outputs
make verify       # rebuild and check against the committed reference outputs
```

Make targets: `all` (figures + tables), `figures`, `tables`, `manuscript`,
`notebooks` (committed inline-figure notebooks under `notebooks/`), `verify`,
`clean`. Set `PYTHON=...` to point at a specific interpreter.

## Environment

`environment.yml` is a version-pinned, pruned subset of the `pangeo-2025`
environment — the analysis stack (numpy, pandas, xarray, scipy,
statsmodels, netCDF4, matplotlib), the jupytext/nbconvert notebook build, and
`poppler` (for the `pdftoppm` figure comparison in `make verify`). No cartopy or
gridded fields are needed: the SST-map and PMM sections of the original scripts
are not part of the manuscript and are cut.

## Repository layout

```
data/         frozen input data (Zenodo v2) + SHA256SUMS
scripts/      analysis in jupytext percent format + verify.py
figures/      the manuscript's 12 figures    (committed reference outputs)
tables/       the manuscript's 6 LaTeX tables (committed reference outputs)
manuscript/   self-contained LaTeX source + cited-only bibliography
notebooks/    executed notebooks, figures inline (built by `make notebooks`,
              generated from scripts/, never hand-edited; committed for browsing)
environment.yml  Makefile
```

## Reproduction map

Two scripts produce every output; each writes both figures and tables.

### `scripts/global_temperature_enso-prediction.py` — 9 figures, 4 tables

| Output | Kind |
|---|---|
| `eofs_pcs.pdf` | figure |
| `reconstruction_2pc.pdf` | figure |
| `pc_correlations.pdf` | figure |
| `fit_all.pdf` | figure |
| `variance_explained_dc.pdf` | figure |
| `simplified_pred.pdf` | figure |
| `corr_dec_n34_by_month.pdf` | figure |
| `fit_idea2.pdf` | figure |
| `forecast.pdf` | figure |
| `regression_table_full.tex` | table |
| `regression_table_r1.tex` | table |
| `regression_table_dc2.tex` | table |
| `regression_table_dc2_roni.tex` | table |

### `scripts/nmme_comparison.py` — 3 figures, 2 tables

| Output | Kind |
|---|---|
| `nmme_skill_comparison.pdf` | figure |
| `nmme_trajectory_examples.pdf` | figure |
| `nmme_traj_dc_pca.pdf` | figure |
| `nmme_trends_table.tex` | table |
| `nmme_significance_table.tex` | table |

The scripts are jupytext percent-format `.py` files (cells + markdown
narration). `make notebooks` renders and executes them into
`notebooks/*.ipynb` with figures inline; the `.ipynb` files are build products
and are never hand-edited.

## Verification

`make verify` rebuilds every figure and table into a scratch tree (`.verify/`)
and compares against the committed reference copies in `figures/` and `tables/`:

- **tables** must be character-identical (`diff`-clean);
- **figures** are rendered with `pdftoppm` and compared pixel-by-pixel.

On the machine and BLAS/LAPACK build that generated the reference outputs the
match is exact (18/18 outputs). On other hardware, **visual identity** is the
standard (sub-percent pixel shifts in the sub-leading modes are possible — see
below); `verify` reports each output as `EXACT`, `WITHIN-TOL`, or `FAIL`.

The figure PDFs are written with `savefig(..., metadata={'CreationDate': None})`
so their bytes carry no build timestamp: `make all` is byte-reproducible and
leaves a clean `git status` on any machine that reproduces the pixels exactly.

### Known limitation — `regression_table_full.tex` (float32 SVD, sub-leading modes)

The archive stores the observed Niño-3.4 and GMST series as **float32** (the
analysis's native in-memory dtype — the two are bit-identical). The PCA
therefore runs in float32. The 4-PC benchmark table `regression_table_full.tex`
uses the low-variance **GMST-PC2** mode, whose singular-value gap is small
(s₂→s₃ ≈ 0.12; variance 3.1 % → 1.3 %). A float32 singular vector on such a gap
is sensitive at the ~10⁻³ level to the exact LAPACK/BLAS implementation, so two
cells of this table can differ by one unit in the last printed digit across
environments (e.g. a coefficient of `-0.11899` rounding to `-0.119` vs `-0.118`,
and its adjusted R²). This is a numerical-library artifact, **not** a data or
porting difference:

- the archived inputs are bit-identical (max |diff| = 0) to the source raw data;
- the other three regression tables and all figures that depend only on the
  dominant leading modes reproduce exactly;
- only PC2-derived quantities move (this table, plus sub-2 % pixel shifts in the
  PC2 curves and correlation-value annotations of `eofs_pcs.pdf`,
  `reconstruction_2pc.pdf`, `simplified_pred.pdf`, and `pc_correlations.pdf`).

The port deliberately keeps the float32 SVD to match the source code exactly;
casting to float64 would improve conditioning but diverge from the reference.
`make verify` treats this table under the visual-identity standard (reported as
`WARN`, not `FAIL`, if it moves).
